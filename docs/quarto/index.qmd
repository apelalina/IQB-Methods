This website was created using Quarto. It is hosted on GitHub. In this chapter we will look at the underlying structure of this website, and how to update it. 

## Setup
This website uses [`renv`](../../posts/r_sig/23_11_06_renv/index.qmd) to keep the project specific package library up to date. The needed packages are recorded in the `.lock`-file, but not uploaded to GitHub. So the *first thing you need to do* is to install the necessary packages into your local project library:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("renv")
renv::restore()
```

## File structure
Basically you just need to know where to put your files. Everything else will be taken care of by pushing to GitHub.
Files can go into one of two folders: `docs` or `posts`. `docs` contains most of the tutorial files: They are structured into sub folders, like `eatPackages` or `R`. Here the quarto-files can be found that contain the actual website content. Just edit them or add new ones. Just make sure they are quarto-files with the `.qmd` ending. 

### `_quarto.yml`
On the highest directory level you can find the `_quarto.yml` file. It defines the structure of the website. If you want your new page to be displayed in the website navigation, you have to add it here. You can define different sections and give the links to the websites different names:

```
    contents:
      - section: "R Tutorials"
        contents:
          - section: "Introduction"
            contents:
             - docs/R/index.qmd
             - href: https://nickhaf.github.io/r_tutorial/
               text: Selfpaced R Workshop
             - href: docs/R/ws1.qmd
               text: Einführung
```

This creates the section `R Tutorials` with the subsection `Introduction`. Introduction consists of three pages: the `index.qmd` page, wich is like the main page of this section, the page `Selfpaced R Workshop`, which actually is only a link to another website, and the page `Einführung`, which links to the qmd-file `ws1.qmd`. Just add your pages where appropriate. 


### quarto-files
The quarto-files contain the actual content of the website. Just edit them like you would edit `.qmd`-files (or `.rmd`-files, as the rmarkdown syntax is quite similar). Here are some useful tips:

#### Linking
You can easily link to other pages of this website, or to other websites:

`[displayed text](link.de)`

You might need to use relative paths:
`[`renv`](../../posts/r_sig/23_11_06_renv/index.qmd)`
This will link to the `renv` page in the `posts` directory. 

#### Pictures
To add a picture to your website, save the picture in the same folder as your `.qmd`-file. Then you can display it with:

`![](my_image.jpg)`

#### Footnotes
You can add footnotes with:

```
Add a footnote[^2].

[^2]: My Footnote.
```

Add a footnote[^2].

[^2]: My Footnote.

## Building the website
To get a preview of your website, just click on the `Render` button in R Studio. This is not necessary however, because the website will only be built online when you push to github and merge into main. It will take a while (up to 20 min or more, depending on the size of the website) until the website is updated, as some checks are run first.
