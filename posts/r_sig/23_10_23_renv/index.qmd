## Motivation

Package versions will change over time. The same goes for R versions. As a consequence, they might work different in the future, which can make it difficult to reproduce your scripts. Therefore it is considered good practice to note down the package and R-versions you use. The package [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) can help you with that.

## Workflow

We already have an [article](https://iqb-research.github.io/IQB-Methods/docs/reproduce/renv.html) on the website. Or take a look at the official [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) documentation.
