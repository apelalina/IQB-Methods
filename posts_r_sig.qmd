The "Special Interest Group" about R (R-SIG) takes place every other week. We talk about all kinds of topics related to coding in R. Drop by if you're interested! 

# Structure
Each session you will have the opportunity to bring in R-related questions which we will discuss for 10 - 15 minutes. **Please send them in the Friday before the next session.**
The rest of the time we will deal with a specific topic. There will be a short input and then a practical part each time, so you can try out everything we're talking about.  

A suggestion for a timetable we can loosely follow: 
- 13:00 - 13:15: Input
- 13:15 - 13:35: Exercise time :)
- 13:35 - 13:50: Discuss exercises
- 13:50 - 14:10: Questions

# Future Topics
Here a list of possible topics for the next sessions. 

- [] **`tidyverse`**
  - [] Introduction
  - [] Data wrangling 
  - [] Plotting with `ggplot2`
- [] Recap of "Advanced Basics": 
  - [] Own functions
  - [] loops
  - [] apply-family
- [] Package development and how it might be relevant for scientific analyses: 
  - [] Own functions
  - [] Structure of projects
  - [] Testing!
- [] Code Review: How to improve code I (or somebody else) has written. **You can send in your code, it might be a nice way of getting feedback you won't get otherwise**. (Code review is very common in programming, as it can be very helpful to get some feedback or learn about different ways of doing stuff).
- [] Coding Kata: The website [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com) let's you solve different coding challenges.
